Welcome to the front end project created during week 10 of a 13 week coding boot camp at North Coders. The code for the back end of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/qigongcoder/NCAPI).

[Here](https://reliable-conkies-3b1b19.netlify.app/) is where you can find a deployed version of the front end, hosted on Neflify.

The basis idea is that this a Readit Clone, but without user registration and authentication. The aim of the code was to combine an understanding of how a backend server and database worked with a frontend developed with React. Therefore, the main aim of the project was to successfully make various http requests that then get updated on the frontend.

You can get a list of articles and perform basic sorting and filtering on them. Then you can choose a specific article to vote on, add a comment, or remove a comment.

If you were to install this code locally, the version of node I used was v22.1.0. To get it running locally, in the terminal type the following;

- mkdir repo
- cd repo
- git clone https://github.com/qigongcoder/fe-nc-news
- cd fe-nc-news
- npm install
- npm i axios
